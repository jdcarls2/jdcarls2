Hello, all.

My name is Josh Carlson.

I work as the GIS Cadastral Analyst for Kendall County GIS (that's in Illinois).

In my spare time, I contribute to the map at OpenStreetMap a bunch.

I also hang around the Esri Community forums a lot to ask and answer questions, since I *do* use lots of Esri products in my professional life.
